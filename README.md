WordNetSharp
============

A .NET library for the WordNet lexical database

#Credit

This library was created by Matt Gerber and is available in its original form here http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/software.

More information on the WordNet project is available here http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/.

#Overview

The WordNet project is described on its website as follows:
> WordNet(tm) is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), 
> each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.

WordNetSharp allows you to use .NET to easily interact with the WordNet database.

#Examples
